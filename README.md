How do I approach designing software?
The first thing I do is understanding the requirments. I will read the instructions, ask questions to clarify anything that is not completely understood, and then start plannning. I will plan the system out and then break it apart into smaller components so that they are all defined and planned for. By having all the requirements and planning code to satisfy the requirments, I am ensured the project covers everything. First I would do the back end to ensure we have everything needed for the front end. By seperating the front and back end, you can keep private code, private. this also helps with security. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has taught me about designing real world scenes. I now know how to create a 3D object, I can add a texture to the object. I can create a camera that acts as the user's view. This camera can be user commanded by the keypad. The user can move forware, left, right, back, up and down. I have learned how to add colors and lighting to a scene to help enhance the real world perspective. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I first understood the code of that was provided for the assignment. I then understood the requirements. I then planned what I needed to add to satisfy the requirments. After planning I begin to code. I test after each method to ensure they work. I then adjust the code to get the scene just right. I test in between each change. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I now know how to implement the features so in future projects, it will be a lot faster for me to complete the work. It took a lot of trial and error while learning, but after doing it a few times, I am more efficient.

How do I approach developing programs?
The process I used was planning, coding, and testing. I planned what to do by reviewing the code and understanding what I have then planning the next step. I then wrote the code and tested as I went to ensure each function or change works. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I did a lot of testing when developing my code. I would constantly check each change that I made and made sure I usderstood what was going on. This helped me get the scene just right.

 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I was getting better as the class went on. When I began it was a lot to handle. There were many files to deal with and many classes working together to create a scene. As the class went on, we dealt with more and more which helped us learn a large amount without it being overwhelming. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me create amazing things for this world. Computers are able to provide us with fast and acurate functions. We use them all around the world and will only rely on them more and more as time goes on.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It helped me in more than just one aspect. It computer graphics and visualizations use a lot of files. They have a lot going on so it shows that I can handle a lot of informationa dn use them all to create a 3D scene. These skills can be applied in any project.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similarly to the educaitonal pathway, these skills can help me manage the code and add to it. By understanding how code works, how files work, and how to link them, you can work on most projects.
